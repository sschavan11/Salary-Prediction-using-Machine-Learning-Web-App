# Project: Salary-Prediction

1️⃣Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/namindusanchila/salary-prediction-with-tensorflow-sequential-lr (rfrence)

❗  *Important Libraries and Modules:* Python 3,Pandas,NumPy,Seaborn,Scikit-learn,Matplotlib,SciPy,Jupyter


🎯 *PRIMARY GOAL :* The purpose of this project is to use data transformation and machine learning to create a model that will predict a salary when given years of experience, job type. The purpose of this project is to use data transformation and machine learning to create a model that will predict a salary when given years of experience, job type.

Data The data for this model is fairly simplified as it has very few missing pieces. The raw data consists of a training dataset with the features listed above and their corresponding salaries.

Information Used To Predict Salaries Years Experience: How many years of experience .

This model can be used as a guide when determining salaries since it shows reasonable predictions when given information on years of experience.

**Methods Used:**

🟢Data Analysis and Visualization

🟢Linear Regression

🟢Polynomial Transformation

🟢Ridge Regression

🟢Random Forest


Data: The raw data consists of a training dataset with the features listed above and their corresponding salaries. Twenty percent of this training dataset was split into a test dataset with corresponding salaries. There is also a testing dataset that does not have any salary information available and was used as a substitute for real-world data.




Information Used To Predict Salaries:
*Years Experience*: How many years of experience
This is project predicts the salary of the employee based on the experience.

**Model Training :-**
model.py trains and saves the model to the disk.
model.pkb the pickle model.

**Run App :-**
app.py contains all the requiered for flask and to manage APIs.
